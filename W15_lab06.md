Issues/Observations -  Hangman 
-Number of remaining guesses donâ€™t appear when you get a guess right; number of guesses left should always appear
-Hints sometimes are letters already guessed
-Option to guess whole word 

GUI Improvements
-Wrong guesses should be moved next to the hangman image
-Field bar for entering guess is too long
-Random background color option only changes bottom bar, which doesn't add any visual appeal
-"Hints Allowed" is superfluous, it is sufficient to know how many hints left
-Hangman is too simple

Unclear things with present Issues
-Issue #18 and #19: How would we go about comparing scores between players "over a network"? Point value should maybe be adjusted.
